-> Ways To Pass Data From Controllers to View
1. ViewBag or ViewData
2. Dynamic type
3. Strongly typed view

Advantages Of Using strongly typed Views
1. Intellisense and
2. Compile-time error checking

Note:- With ViewBag and Dynamic type, we don't have these advantages.

(1) Using Static
-> @ViewBag.EmployeeData.FullName

(2) Using Dynamic Model Type
-> @model dynamic
-> it will render model which is passed from controller

(3) Strongly Typed View
-> We use full model name in view


-> Partal View

-> It is use to create view componenets, it can be create in inside shared folder or view folder and we can use it in any view and it render section
