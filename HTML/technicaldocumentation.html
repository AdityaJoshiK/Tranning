                HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard language for creating web-pages. Every web page you surf on your browser is built using HTML. The primary use of HTML to provide a proper structure to the web-page so all the content or data of the page could represent adequately. A stand-alone HTML can create only static and skeleton looking black and white pages, but with the help of CSS and JavaScript , we can create a more interactive and intuitive web-page. When we try to visit a website or click on the link, we basically request the server to show us the page, then the server acts on our request and sends us an appropriate HTML document as a response. Then this HTML document parsed by browse, and we able to see the content.

                The HTML elements provide the semantic meaning to the web-page content. We usually interchangeably use the term HTML elements and tags, but technically both are different. An HTML tag is just a character inside the angle bracket<>, whereas the HTML element is a collection of starting tag, its attribute, content and end tag

            <h2 id="attributes">HTML Attributes</h2>
            <p>
                In HTML, the attributes are used to provide additional information about the elements. For most of the HTML elements, attributes are optional, but there are some elements where we have to deliver the attributes. Attributes always specified within the opening tag of the HTML element and they specified in a name and value pair. In this example src ="cat.jpg" and alt="cat image" are two attributes where src and alt are attributes name and "cat.jpg" and "cat image" are attributes values. Here alt attribute is optional, but src is mandatory because src specify which image to show. There should be at least one space gap between two attributes, and the value of the attributes must have resided in the double inverted comma. Some most important HTML
