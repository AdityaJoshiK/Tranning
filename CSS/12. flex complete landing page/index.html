	The Car Information System is a web-based application designed to provide users with easy access to essential information about cars. The system aims to simplify the process of gathering information about different car models, their specifications, features, and reviews. It is particularly useful for individuals interested in purchasing a new car or comparing various car options.

Certainly, here's the information about the "Cataloguing" module in your "CarInfo" project:

**Cataloguing**

The Cataloguing module in "CarInfo" allows you to create a comprehensive catalog of car information. It's designed to encompass various details related to car models, specifications, features, and user reviews. This module functions as the foundation for organizing and managing the vast collection of car data within the system. Just as a library catalog organizes and categorizes books, "CarInfo's" Cataloguing module serves to structure and make accessible the extensive database of car information, making it easy for users to search, explore, and evaluate different car models.

Certainly, here's the description for the "Circulation" module in your "CarInfo" project:

**Circulation**

The Circulation module in "CarInfo" manages the process of issuing and returning car information within the system. It operates as an efficient and uniform system, enabled by barcode and smart card technology. This module allows for seamless handling of the issue and return of car information, ensuring accuracy and ease of use. Users can request information, interact with the system, and access their own accounts, making it a user-friendly and streamlined experience within the "CarInfo" project.


Certainly, here's the information about the user classes and their characteristics for your "CarInfo" project:

**User Classes and Characteristics**

In "CarInfo," various types of users interact with the system for different purposes. These user classes include:

- **ADMINISTRATOR:** This user class is analogous to a librarian in a traditional library. Administrators have the authority to manage the "CarInfo" system and its database. They play a pivotal role in continuously updating and maintaining car records, ensuring the smooth functioning of the system. Administrators oversee the issuance of cars, manage user accounts, and maintain the comprehensive car database.

- **ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR:** Also known as a "Librarian Database," this user class assists the administrator in managing the "CarInfo" system. They support with database maintenance, user inquiries, and system operations, ensuring that the system runs efficiently.

- **MEMBER:** Members are registered users who have authorization to access and interact with the car information system. Similar to library members, they can browse, search, and interact with detailed car information, including specifications, features, and user reviews. Members have the privilege to save favorite cars, submit their own reviews, customize their profiles, and receive personalized car recommendations.

- **GUEST:** Guests in "CarInfo" are equivalent to individuals without a library membership. They visit the system without registration and can access basic features, such as browsing a limited list of cars and their basic details. Guests have the option to request membership to the system.

These user classes exhibit distinct characteristics, access levels, and roles within the "CarInfo" project, enhancing the overall user experience and system functionality.


Certainly, here's a concise description of the design and implementation constraints for your "CarInfo" project:

**Design and Implementation Constraints**

- Passwords must be kept confidential by Librarians and Assistant Librarians to ensure system security.
- Resource management, such as adding and editing car information, is exclusively granted to the Librarian.
- Each user, whether a Member or Guest, is assigned an individual ID for secure account access.
- The issuance of Guest user memberships is solely managed by the Librarian, ensuring controlled access to the system.
  
These constraints are integral to data security and user management in "CarInfo," enhancing system reliability and user privacy.
